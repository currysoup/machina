# machina
Just a hobby, wonâ€™t be big and professional like GNU/Linux.

## How to run
On linux machines:
* `make run`
* done!

For other operating systems, or if you just want to keep your dev environment seperate.
* `vagrant up`
* `vagrant rsync-auto` (As a job or in another terminal)
* `vagrant ssh`
* `cd /vagrant`
* `make run`
* done!
